        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Joseph Nam. I am Korean and currently I am 18 years old. I enjoy playing basketball and spending time with friends and family during my free time. I also like to workout at the gym and go for runs in the morning. Music is a key part of my life as I really enjoy listening to music as it helps me get through different feelings and stages of my life. Postivity and hardwork are key components that I live by and believe in. I believe that if you set a postive outlook on life, people will tend to follow and connections will form due to your postive deeds returning back to you. I also believe that if you work hard and try your best everyday to accompish your goals, success will come with it no matter if you complete or fail your goal. There will always be things you can gain in life by working hard and keeping strong. <br><br>

        I have graduated high school with honors and I am now attending college in pursue of my degree. I am a undergraduate freshman student at the University of California Riverside. I am currently an undeclared student intersted in joining the business program as I am taking and prepraring for business classes that will help enhance my knowledge in the field of business. I am taking classes such as English, Public Policy, and Computer Programming in search of both my degree and my major in business. I am working hard to learn as much as I can these four years of college, taking classes of interest and that are required for me to succeed once I graduate college. I hope to accumalate all this learning and knowledge and use it right away for the career I fall in to. <br><br>

        I try to keep a positive outlook on life, ignoring the distractions that can come in the way of my success. I am a hardworker and I constantly try my best in whatever comes my way to the best of my ability. I like to set and keep track of the goals that I set for myself and I am responsible enough to make sure I stay on track with all my schedule and work laid out for me. I want to experience all that life has to offer and I want to accumalate that experience into wisdom so that I can not only be successful in my future job but just in life in general. Even through failure I am always looking to see where I went wrong and what I can do to not make that mistake happen again, and I believe that is the most important type of learning. By trying and experiencing new things, I am acculamting all this new knowledge learning from it as I can later implement it into my life.
